fish|Alive without breath, As cold as death; Never thirsty, ever drinking, All in mail never clinking.
eggses|A box without hinges, key, or lid, Yet golden treasure inside is hid.
snail|If a man carried my burden he would break his back. I am not big but leave silver in my tracks.
hands|What do you use to hoe a row, slay a foe, and wring with woe?
shadow|Only one color, but not one size; Present in sun but not in rain;
colors|I come in a cone, though am not food; I come in millions but you can name only a few.
